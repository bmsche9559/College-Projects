# Roller Coasters Database & Java Flappy Bird Game

## Introduction
As a recent college graduate passionate about web development and Java, I created this repository to showcase my skills through two distinct projects. These projects highlight my ability to build interactive web applications and implement game mechanics using Java.

## Projects
### 1. Record-Breaking Roller Coasters (HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Database)
This web project presents an interactive experience exploring some of the world’s most thrilling record-breaking roller coasters. The website is designed with a clean, responsive layout, ensuring accessibility across devices. It also includes a simple database storing coaster details such as height, speed, and inversions.

#### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### 2. Flappy Bird Clone (Java Game)
This is a simplified version of the popular Flappy Bird game, built using Java. The project demonstrates my understanding of game physics, collision detection, and UI rendering using Java Swing.

#### Key Features:
- **Gravity & Collision Mechanics:** Implements physics-based movement.
- **Score Tracking:** Displays real-time scores.
- **Smooth Gameplay:** Game loop ensures consistent performance.

#### Technologies Used:
- Java
- Java Swing

## Running the Projects
### Roller Coaster Website:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   ```
2. Alternatively, view the live site using GitHub Pages:
   ```

   ```

### Flappy Bird Clone:
1. Ensure Java is installed.
2. Compile and run the game:
   ```sh
   javac FlappyBird.java
   java FlappyBird
   ```

## Why These Projects Matter
These projects reflect my ability to design engaging web applications and implement interactive game mechanics. They demonstrate problem-solving, creativity, and an understanding of real-world software development principles.

## Looking Forward
I am eager to apply these skills in a professional setting, collaborate on new projects, and continue expanding my expertise in web and software development.
