# Roller Coasters Database & Various Java Projects

## Introduction
As a recent college graduate passionate about web development and Java, I created this repository to showcase my skills through two distinct projects. These projects highlight my ability to build interactive web applications and implement game mechanics using Java.

## Projects
### 1. Semester Project - Record-Breaking Roller Coasters (HTML, CSS, JavaScript & Database)
This web project presents an interactive experience exploring some of the world’s most thrilling record-breaking roller coasters. The website is designed with a clean, responsive layout, ensuring accessibility across devices. It also includes a simple database storing coaster details such as height, speed, and inversions.

#### Technologies Used:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### 2. Csci_homework - Beginner Java Projects
This is a collection of various java projects during my beginner computer science classes.

#### A. Unit 2 - Csci1302_hw2 - Flappy Bird Clone (Java Game)
This is a simplified version of the popular Flappy Bird game, built using Java. The project demonstrates my understanding of game physics, collision detection, and UI rendering using Java Swing.

##### Key Features:
- **Collision Mechanics:** Implements physics-based movement.
- **Score Tracking:** Displays real-time scores.
- **Smooth Gameplay:** Game loop ensures consistent performance.

#### B. hw5 - Csci1302_hw5 - Simple Queue Project
The premise of this assignment was to create a theme park attraction queue with a given amount of riders during the day. Our goal of this project was to assign a certain amount of riders, give them names, give them a random wait time, give the total number of riders and the avergae wait time.

#### C. Unit 4 - Csci1302_hw4 - Simple Sort Search
This was a java project based on a sort search of a list of soldiers. Our task was to conduct a sort search to find a specific soldier in a list of given soldiers.

### 3. Data Structure - Simple Challenge Activities
Listed is some quick java challenges from my Data Structure class. These are added to showcase my ability to write simplified code and complete tasks with minimal lines of code while making it understandable.

### 4. Lab_1_Databases_Bradley - SQL project
This is a Java project in my databases class that was used to connect with a SQL server. This shows my understanding of SQL and Java integration, and my ability to update databases using a Java project.

#####Technologies Used:
- Java
- Java Swing
