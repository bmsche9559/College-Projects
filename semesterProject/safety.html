        <h2 style="text-decoration:underline">Safety Mechanisms on Roller Coasters</h2>
        <p>Roller coasters are designed with a variety of safety mechanisms to ensure the well-being of riders. Here are some common safety features:</p><br>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Over-the-Shoulder Restraints:</strong> These secure riders in their seats and prevent them from standing up during the ride. This is one of two types of restraint 
            systems you would typically see on a roller coaster train. In the early 90s this type of restraint was extremely common for coasters with inversions; however, they have become hated 
            by coaster enthusiasts due to headbanging and are often replaced with modern lap bar restraints.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Lap Bars:</strong> Lap bars provide an additional layer of security, holding riders in place during twists and turns. This type of restraint has become the most popular 
            type of restraint leaving riders feel open and free while twisting through the air.</li><br>
            <img src="pictures/El_Toro_seat.jpg" alt="Lap bar restraint" height="300" width="500"><br><br>
            <li><strong>Block Zones:</strong> Block zones are sections of roller coaster track that end in a emergency braking system in order to stop the coaster train if need be. This is the system 
            that allows multiple trains to be on track at the same time and is also a safety mechanism that prevents trains from colliding with one another. This is accomplished by the use of sensors 
            along the track that activate when a train passes over it and are often the green blocks you may find along the track.</li><br>
            <img src="pictures/blockZones.webp" alt="Block zones" height="300" width="500"><br><br>
            <li><strong>Automatic Emergency Brakes:</strong> Roller coasters are equipped with automatic emergency brakes that engage if there is any issue detected during the ride. 
            These are the braking mechanisms located at the end of block zones in order to bring the train to a stop if necessary. These systems have evolved over the years from using friction to now using 
            magnets and they are stronger and safer than ever before.</li><br>
            <img src="pictures/brakes.jpg" alt="Braking System" height="300" width="500"><br><br>
            <li><strong>Anti-Rollback Systems:</strong> These systems prevent the coaster from rolling backward on the track, ensuring a smooth and controlled ride experience. These are found on chain lift hills typically found at the beginning of the ride. 
            This is the cause of the clicking sound during the lift hill that brings fear to unknowing riders. These have also evolved into magnetic brakes when a coaster is launched down the track instead of using a chain lift. 
            The same magnets that are used to launch the train also have the ability to stop the train incase the train fails to complete the launch.</li><br>

            <li><strong>Height and Health Restrictions:</strong> Riders must meet certain height and health requirements to ensure their safety on specific rides. These are located on info boards located throughout the queue line for the ride and are 
            often ignored by riders although they are listed for a reason. It is essential that riders read they safety risks and restrictions in order to prevent tragic accidents.</li><br>

        <p>Roller coaster safety is a top priority for amusement parks, and daily routine inspections are conducted to ensure that all safety features are functioning correctly.</p><br><br>
